## Personal Hobby Project - ChatBot Program
This Chatbot project is built with NodeJS and utilizes the DiscordJS API.
The program interfaces with the user on a Discord Server.
Users enter text commands on text channels within the server to interface with the program.
The program outputs text and other useful information on the same text channel.
## Motivation, Intended Use
This is a personal/fun bot I created for convenience.
Most notably, the bot can pull the top songs on the Korean Music Charts. https://www.melon.com/
Additionally, some commands are related to puzzles for the online game OldSchoolRunescape.
